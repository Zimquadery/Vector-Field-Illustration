# Vector Flow Field Visualization

This project visualizes a vector flow field using the p5.js library. The flow field is generated using Perlin noise and displayed on an HTML canvas. Users can interact with the visualization by clicking to drop particles. [Click here for demo](https://zimquadery.github.io/Vector-Field-Illustration/)

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the p5.js and p5.sound.js libraries and runs the `sketch.js` script.
- `jsconfig.json`: Configuration file for JavaScript.
- `libraries/`: Directory containing the p5.js and p5.sound.js libraries.
- `sketch.js`: The main JavaScript file that contains the p5.js code to create and draw the vector flow field.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML elements.


## Usage

- The visualization will start automatically when the page is loaded.
- Click on the canvas to drop particles and see how they interact with the flow field.
